# IQsitorium

> *"In the labyrinth of cognition, the measure of one's intellect lies not merely in knowledge, but in the alacrity of thought, the elegance of logic, and the symmetry of reasoning."*  
> — A Modern Digital Sage (aka IQsitorium App)

## Introduction

This humble digital artefact — a Flask-based web application — endeavours to serve as a mirror to the human intellect. Designed with minimalist elegance and maximal pedagogical purpose, it invites users to engage in a brief but revealing inquisition into their reasoning faculties.

By presenting a series of logically sequenced multiple-choice interrogatives, the application aspires not merely to *test* intelligence, but to celebrate it. Whether you're a fledgling logician or a cerebrally-inclined dilettante, this app has something to tickle your grey cells.
